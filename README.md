# UME
## Decentralized Social Media built on Ethereum Blockchain

v0.1.0-beta.1

----------------------------------------------------------

### What is UME?
UME is a decentralized, user-governed micro-blogging platform built on the Ethereum Blockchain. UME seeks to solve the following problems which plague social media:
- Feed algorithms are designed to maximize attention and tap into negative negative emotions, i.e. insecurity, anger, envy, dysphoria, anxiety, etc.
- Publicly-traded social media companies hold a fiduciary obligation to stockholders so in order to maintain their business model, they cannot abandon these attention-driven algorithms which make sure that users stay engaged with the service
- Negative engagement boosts algorithmic viability, because it's more stimulating than veracity or positive engagement, so these algorithms are designed to favor content that triggers fight-or-flight responses over calm rationality
- These algorithms disproportionately reward misinformation and vitriol, so the "free speech" these platforms provide is misleading because it privileges certain speech over others
- The demand for social media companies to censor is generated by these attention-driven-algorithms privileging engaging misinfo over calm fact
- Attempts at censorship backfire and galvanize those who are censored, thereby vindicating those who purvey misinformation
- Algorithmic attempts at censorhip will also target those _calling out the misinformation_, i.e. people who make YouTube videos calling out the danger of Holocaust Denial on YouTube, instead of the Holocaust-denying channels themselves
- Social media companies have an incentive to not get rid of such divisive, misinformative accounts because they keep users engaged, so suspensions and bannings are incredibly inconsistent and usually fall along the company's political biases
- Algorithmic echochambers are formed, fracturing society into different realities, where facts can be completely inverted between different groups
- The "rules" of the algorithm are incredibly inconsistent, and they are constantly gamed in a way which benefit nefarious actors and regress social cohesion
- People need to be aware of the rules, and those rules need to be facilitated to promote healthy engagement and disincentivize trolling, spam, and negative engagement

### Why is UME different?
- By engaging with posts--called 'memes'-- users are rewarded UME, an ERC-20 token redeemable within the UME ecosystem to promote and demote posts at the user's discretion
- More UME tokens are rewarded to the account the user engages with, incentivizing positive interactions because they always benefit the receiving end of the interaction more than the user
- By default, the UME feed amplifies positive engagements, i.e. liking and commenting, which reward UME to both parties as well as boosting the interacted posts proportionate to natural engagement
- All other algorithmic functionality is left to the whims of the community, rather than a board of directors, CEO, or government agency putting its finger on the scale
- UME can only be generated by posting and engaging
- Gas fees aren't subsidized so spam is disincentivized by cost to user

## How do I use UME?

**UME** is currently deployed to the **Ropsten Ethereum Testnet**. In order to participate in the UME beta test, you will need the following:

- Node v16.8.0
- Git
- Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or a Chromium browser (Brave, Opera, etc.)
- MetaMask Wallet

## Installing Node
### via Node Version Manager
Node Version Manager can be installed on Mac/Linux/Unix systems [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
or on Windows `nvm ` can be installed [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

## Installing Git
Git can be installed [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow instructions onsite for your particular OS.
To clone repository, do:
```
git clone https://github/top-shaman/ume-eth
```

## Installing Chrome, Brave, or Firefox
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
In the current version, **UME cannot run on mobile browsers.**

## Installing MetaMask
### Downloading MetaMask
MetaMask is an Cryptocurrency Wallet built for Browsers that allows users to interact with Blockchains. It can be downloaded [here](https://metamask.io/download).
### Set up your MetaMask Wallet
Set up your MetaMask Wallet by following the instructions, make sure to keep your mnemonic phrase safe and secure-- do **not** share with anyone!

## Accessing the Ropsten Ethereum Testnet
### Set MetaMask Network to Ropsten
Change MetaMask Network to Ropsten by selecting **Ropsten** from list of Networks (default set to Ethereum)
![Highlight Network Select](/public/Network.png)
![Select Ropsten](/public/Select-Account.png)
### Getting Ropsten Ethereum
Visit the Ropsten Ethereum Faucet [here](https://faucet.ropsten.be/) or [here](https://faucet.dimensions.network/) and enter your Wallet Public Key to receive Ropsten Ethereum. Wallet Public Key can be easily copied by clicking 'Account Name' in MetaMask Wallet:
![Copying Key](/public/Copy-Account.png)
After you enter the queue, it should take ~15-60 seconds to hit your wallet.\n

\* _**If you ever need to add more Ropsten Ethereum**, you can use the same faucet after 24 hrs, use the other faucet, or access the same faucet using a different Wallet and different IP address using a VPN._

## Running UME web app via `node`
Now that we've installed everything and funded our wallets with rETH, we can run the UME web app.

### Hosting web app on local node server
With your root directory selected, in a bash shell run:
```
npm run start
```
Node should automatically open the app in your default browser, but if it doesn't, set your browser URL to `localhost:3000`

### Connecting Wallet to UME
You should see a prompt to connect your Wallet to UME:
![Connect account](/public/Connect-Account.png)

If not, you should see a blue flag on your MetaMask Browser icon, like this:
![MetaMask notification](/public/MetaMask-Notification.png)
Click it, and then you should be able to connect.\n

\* _Be sure to pay attention to your MetaMask, because if there's a pending action, it will show a similar flag_\n

\*\* _You must be in Ropsten Ethereum Network to connect Wallet to Network, a flag should pop up saying 'UME not deployed to network' if you're on the wrong network_

## UME User Guide
### Creating a Profile
Being a dApp that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, authentication is performed intrinsically via MetaMask-- your UME account is tied to your Public Key, which is only accessible via your Private Key, which you access via MetaMask. In other words, you don't need a password-- it's all tied to your MetaMask wallet.

Create your username & address and write your profile to the Blockchain A notification will pop up on the MetaMask icon in your browser to initiate the transaction
![Account creation](/public/Account-Create.png)
\* _This will be how you interact with the Blockchain-- transactions write data onto the Blockchain so each interaction: liking, following, posting, etc. will require transactions._
