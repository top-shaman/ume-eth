# UME
## Decentralized Social Media built on Ethereum Blockchain

v0.1.0-beta.1

----------------------------------------------------------

### What is UME?
UME is a decentralized, user-governed micro-blogging platform built on the Ethereum Blockchain. UME seeks to solve the following problems which plague social media:
- Feed algorithms are designed to maximize attention and tap into negative negative emotions, i.e. insecurity, anger, envy, dysphoria, anxiety, etc.
- Publicly-traded social media companies hold a fiduciary obligation to stockholders so in order to maintain their business model, they cannot abandon these attention-driven algorithms which make sure that users stay engaged with the service
- Negative engagement boosts algorithmic viability, because it's more stimulating than veracity or positive engagement, so these algorithms are designed to favor content that triggers fight-or-flight responses over calm rationality
- These algorithms disproportionately reward misinformation and vitriol, so the "free speech" these platforms provide is misleading because it privileges certain speech over others
- The demand for social media companies to censor is generated by these attention-driven-algorithms privileging engaging misinfo over calm fact
- Attempts at censorship backfire and galvanize those who are censored, thereby vindicating those who purvey misinformation
- Algorithmic attempts at censorhip will also target those _calling out the misinformation_, i.e. people who make YouTube videos calling out the danger of Holocaust Denial on YouTube, instead of the Holocaust-denying channels themselves
- Social media companies have an incentive to not get rid of such divisive, misinformative accounts because they keep users engaged, so suspensions and bannings are incredibly inconsistent and usually fall along the company's political biases
- Algorithmic echochambers are formed, fracturing society into different realities, where facts can be completely inverted between different groups
- The "rules" of the algorithm are incredibly inconsistent, and they are constantly gamed in a way which benefit nefarious actors and regress social cohesion
- People need to be aware of the rules, and those rules need to be facilitated to promote healthy engagement and disincentivize trolling, spam, and negative engagement

### Why is UME different?
- By engaging with posts--called 'memes'-- users are rewarded UME, an ERC-20 token redeemable within the UME ecosystem to promote and demote posts at the user's discretion
- More UME tokens are rewarded to the account the user engages with, incentivizing positive interactions because they always benefit the receiving end of the interaction more than the user
- By default, the UME feed amplifies positive engagements, i.e. liking and commenting, which reward UME to both parties as well as boosting the interacted posts proportionate to natural engagement
- All other algorithmic functionality is left to the whims of the community, rather than a board of directors, CEO, or government agency putting its finger on the scale
- UME can only be generated by posting and engaging
- Gas fees aren't subsidized so spam is disincentivized by cost to user
